# SparkAR
Some basic SparkAR projects
All of the projects will open in SparkAR editor only.
1) Heart project is based on the head nodes and mouth.
2) Globe project is an touch based filter where on clicking the screen changes globe from day to night mode and vice versa.
3) Rotation project is a project where we encounter a basic AR problem and try to solve it. The problem is making an AR object go behind a real world object.
